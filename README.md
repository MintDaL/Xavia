# XaviaBot on Glitch

As you know [glitch](https://www.glitch.com) is a stupid website so i'm here to help you use XaviaBot by glitch. Here are somethings you need to keep in mind:


• You don't need ```npm i``` and ```npm start``` because this website has got you done it.

• When you change any character of any file it will restart automatically. To restrict that add the file [watch.json](https://github.com/MintDaL/Xavia/blob/main/watch.json) to your project to limit that.

• After adding the file watch.json. When you want to restart your project please change any characters in json file.
